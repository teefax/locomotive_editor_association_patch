h1. Locomotive Editor Association Patch


This unofficial patch for the "Locomotive Editor":http://www.locomotivecms.com/modules/locomotive-editor allows pushing of @content_entries@ with @belongs_to@ and @many_to_many@ associations.

h2. Requirements

This unofficial patch was tested with locomotive_editor 1.0.0.rc15 and 1.0.0.rc17.

h2. Installation

#1 "Download this repository":https://github.com/widescape/locomotive_editor_association_patch/archive/master.zip and copy the folders @bin@ and @lib@ into your Locomotive Editor site folder:

bc. /app
/bin <-- Copy the bin folder here
/config
 - compass.rb <-- Edit this file
/lib <-- Copy the lib folder here
/public

#2 Write these lines to the end of the file @/config/compass.rb@:

bc. LocomotiveEditor::Logger.info '...loading patches'
require File.join(LocomotiveEditor.site_root, 'lib', 'editor_decorator', 'editor_decorator.rb')

(We're just using the fact that the file @compass.rb@ is loaded by locomotive_editor at startup)

#3 Ensure that @/bin/locomotive_editor@ is executeable by running in your console:

bc. $ chmod +x bin/locomotive_editor

That's it.

h2. How To Use

Instead of running @$ locomotive_editor push -t [your_target] -r content_entries@ now run:

bc. $ ./bin/locomotive_editor push -t [your_target] -r content_entries
